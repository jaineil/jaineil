### Hey there, a little bit about me 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I'm a graduate student pursuing my Master's in Software Engineering @ San Jose State University.
- 📍 I'm based out in San Jose, CA. 🇺🇸 | But I'm originally from Mumbai, India. 🇮🇳
- 🤓 I love exploring anything related to CS, I'm thriving to become a T-shaped developer with a strong interest in Backend Engineering & Distributed Systems.
- 🌱 I know a little about a lot of things in tech. I read extensively about System Design, Backend Engineering, and Code-design Principles. I see myself as a perennial learner. Not to mention, I write fairly pretty code. 😛 ✨
