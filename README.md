### Hey there, a little bit about me 👋

- 📍 I'm currently based out in Seattle, WA. 🏔️🇺🇸 | But I'm originally from Mumbai, India. 🇮🇳
- 👨‍🎓 I graduated with a Master's degree in Software Engineering from San Jose State University.
- 🤓 I love exploring anything related to computers, and I'm thriving to become a T-shaped backend developer with a strong interest in distributed systems.
- 🌱 I know a little about a lot of things in tech. I read extensively about designing systems, internal workings, code design principles, and coding best practices. I see myself as a perennial learner. Small brag but, I can write fairly pretty code. 😛 ✨

### My work 💻
- 🧑‍💻 Currently, I work as a Software Engineer for the Physical Retail Payments team at Amazon.
  - I'm responsible for designing, developing, testing, and releasing tier-1 payments critical microservices, catering to the physical stores owned/powered by Amazon. 
- 🔙 Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer for Infra team at [Sikka AI](https://sikka.ai/).
  - 👨‍🔧 I'm responsible for deploying and maintaining the cloud infrastructure on Kubernetes.
  - I also write services on AWS that contribute to building resilient distributed systems for a lot of engineering teams.
- 🔙 Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Coursera during the Summer 2022 break of my Master's. 
  - 😮 My primary focus was writing and maintaining scalable Java Spring Boot gRPC microservice to efficiently load and store user settings, impacting ~90 million registered users.
  - I also implemented cache-aside with TTL in Scala to manage periodic updates to the demo admin access for the enterprise platform.
- 🔙 I also have one year of experience in delivering a 0️⃣ to 1️⃣ system in an early-stage startup. [Cerebranium's](https://cerebranium.com/) was building for the ed-tech domain. 
  - 👨‍🔧 There, I engineered scalable, testable solutions for practical problems in Computer Vision while building their state-of-the-art AI Proctoring System. 
  - I also worked on the entire suite of mobile-backend APIs for their [Promexa Institution](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerebranium.betaorionis.institution&hl=en_IN&gl=US) mobile app using TypeScript in Node.js environment, following Test-Driven Development environment and Uncle Bob’s Clean Architecture principles.
