# Hey there! 👋

- 🔭 I'm working on Machine Learning, Backend & Infrastructure at [Cerebranium](https://cerebranium.com/)
- 🤓 Generally, I love exploring anything related to CS, but currently, I'm particularly interested in System Design, Computer Vision and Data Analysis
- 🌱 I'm an armchair expert in Product Management & Entrepreneurship (would like to venture there hands on some day) 
- ⚡ In my free time, I read books/blogs/essays 📚, learn to play the Ukulele 🎸, and watch Chelsea's ⚽️ games
