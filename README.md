### Hey there! 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I'm a graduate student pursuing my Master's (MS) in Computer Software Engineering @ San Jose State University
- 🤓 I love exploring anything related to CS, but I'm a backend-focused Software Engineer by profession.
- 🌱 I know a little about a lot of things in tech. I read extensively about System Design, Backend Engineering, and Code-design Principles. I see myself as a perennial learner. 
---
- 🧑‍💻 I have one-year of experience in delivering 0️⃣ to 1️⃣ systems in an early-stage startup environment within the ed-tech domain. 
- 👨‍🔧 I have engineered scalable, testable solutions for practical problems in Computer Vision while building [Cerebranium's](https://cerebranium.com/) state-of-the-art AI Proctoring System. I also worked on the entire suite of APIs for their Promexa Institution app using TypeScript (Node.js) in a Test-Driven Development environment, following Uncle Bob’s Clean Architecture principles.
- 😛 Not to mention but, I write fairly pretty code. ✨
- ⚙️ In my work, I write code in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript. I've exposure to technologies like Python (OpenCV, TensorFlow 2.0), JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, Express.js), Firebase Firestore, Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Functions, Cloud Tasks, Cloud PubSub, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage), Docker.
---
- 😅 Other than being a developer, I love to get into discussions around startups & businesses, investing, product & philosophy.
- ⚡ In my free time, I read books/blogs/essays 📚, learn to play the Ukulele 🎸, and watch Chelsea's games ⚽️ , and like to get in good workouts 🏋️
