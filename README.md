### Hey there! 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I'm a graduate student pursuing my Master's in Software Engineering @ San Jose State University.
- 📍 I'm based out in San Jose, CA. 🇺🇸 | But I'm originally from Mumbai, India. 🇮🇳
- 🤓 I love exploring anything related to CS, I'm thriving to become a T-shaped developer with a strong interest in Distributed Backend Development.
- 🌱 I know a little about a lot of things in tech. I read extensively about System Design, Backend Engineering, and Code-design Principles. I see myself as a perennial learner. Not to mention, I write fairly pretty code. 😛 ✨

- 🧑‍💻 Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineering Intern at Coursera throughout the Summer break of my Master's. My primary focus is backend where I'm working on Java Spring microservices, Scala to Java migration and AWS infrastructure.
- 🔙 Previously have one-year of experience in delivering 0️⃣ to 1️⃣ systems in an early-stage startup, [Cerebranium's](https://cerebranium.com/) building in the ed-tech domain. 
  - 👨‍🔧 There I have engineered scalable, testable solutions for practical problems in Computer Vision while building their state-of-the-art AI Proctoring System. 
  - I also worked on the entire suite of mobile-backend APIs for their [Promexa Institution](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerebranium.betaorionis.institution&hl=en_IN&gl=US) mobile app using TypeScript in Node.js environment, following Test-Driven Development environment and Uncle Bob’s Clean Architecture principles.
- ⚙ I have worked on some awesome full-stack projects in my Master's so far - [UberEats clone](https://github.com/jaineil/uber-eats-clone), [Indeed.com clone](https://github.com/jaineil/indeed-clone) and [Cloud Event Center](https://github.com/jaineil/cloud-event-center). Feel free to checkout the source code here on my GitHub.
